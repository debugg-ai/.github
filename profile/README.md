[DebuggAI](https://debugg.ai) is a Zero-Config, Fully AI-Managed End-to-End Testing platform that allows engineers to focus on the features, not the tests. Our AI agents test UI changes, simulate user behavior, and analyze visual outputs of running web applications — all via natural language and CLI tools.

## ✨ Why DebuggAI?

Most AI coding tools focus on **writing** code.  
DebuggAI focuses on the other 50 % of an engineer’s life: **getting it to run.**

* **Zero, and we mean Zero Config** - When you're early in a product's life, you don't want to deal with setting up test pipelines, managing test dbs, environments and so on just so they can change the next week (we certainly didn't). Our tests securely tunnel into the IDE and then browse your app using localhost:3000, for example, so there's literally no additional setup.
* **Text based End-to-end Tests** - No more xpath nightmares, simply enter a test request like "test the login flow" and let it go.
* **In IDE Test Reports** - Our e2e tests output results directly in the IDE Test Results panel so you can quickly see what's working and what's not. 
* **Automated test repair** - Our agents not only rerun previous tests but can reconize the difference between a purposeful change of button positioning and a broken workflow.
* **Remote browsers by default** - We handle all the browser management and controllers remotely to keep your enviroment uncluttered and focused.

### 🔍 Typical workflows:

1. You use your favorite AI agent to write code
2. You run your app and it crashes (ah whyyyyy!)
3. DebuggAI runs tests to evaluate the changes and provides a full report
4. You review the solution, edit it locally if needed, and apply it
